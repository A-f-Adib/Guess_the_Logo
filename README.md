<h3> Description</h3> <br>

In this SwiftUI project i built a guessing game that helps users learn some of the many car logos of the world.

This project is nice and easy, it gives me chance to get introduced to whole range of new SwiftUI functionality: stacks, buttons, images, alerts, asset catalogs, and more.

 this app used a completely standard iOS look and feel, here i made something more customized with SwiftUI so anyone can easily play the game.
